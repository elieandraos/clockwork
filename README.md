### Installation

### roadmap
- cover a wide collection of validation rules (inspired from laravel)
- Vue 2 wrapper (another package)
    - isolate with a class that handles validation / error bags / extend / customer errors (ala clockwork)
    - class should accept 2 objects: data and rules
    - class should be isolated from the component instance
    - onblur inline validation
